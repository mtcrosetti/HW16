          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smokers & Income</h2>
          <p>As the graph shows, there is a trend that people in states with lower incomes tend to take up smoking more than
            people in states with higher incomes.
          </p>
          <p>On the high smoking end, 28% of West Virginians are smokers. Their median income was 49th out of 50. On the high end
            of income, Maryland (ranked #1 in median income) had about 16% of their polled population as smokers. 
          </p>
          <p>While the graph was mostly linear, there were some outliers - most notably California and Utah. California's lack of
            smokers could be due to a more healthy lifestyle, though this would require further research. Utah's lack of smoking 
            might be due to a religious element, but this too would require further research.
